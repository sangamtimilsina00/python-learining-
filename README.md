# Python Learning Tasks

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and functions focused on data analysis, sales analytics, and business intelligence concepts. Each notebook cell demonstrates a specific function or calculation, making it a great resource for learning and practicing Python programming with real-world business scenarios.

## Contents

- **Sales Calculations:**  
  Functions for total sales, maximum sale day, sales growth percentage, and moving averages.
- **Data Analysis:**  
  Product-wise sales, top-N products, Pareto analysis (80/20 rule), outlier detection using IQR, and correlation calculation.
- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  Segment customers based on purchase amount.
- **KPI Calculations:**  
  Dynamic KPI calculation, weighted average price, and multi-dimensional sales contribution.
- **Practical Examples:**  
  Each function includes example usage and output for easy understanding.
